## 1. Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases

| Feature         | Flat File System                        | Relational Database                                 |
|:---------------:|:---------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
| **Structure**   | Plain text like .txt and .csv           | Tables with columns and rows                        |
| **Redundancy**  | High, data is often repeated            | Low, data is normalized to reduce redundancy        |
| **Relationships** | Not supported                         | Supported through foreign keys and relationships    |
| **Example Use** | Config files, Excel (.csv) spreadsheets | Banking systems, Oracle, MySQL                      |
| **Drawbacks**   | Inefficient data management             | Complex setup and requires DBMS software to maintain|
